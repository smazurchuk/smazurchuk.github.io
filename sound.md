This is page to demonstrate the real-time input and fourier transform of your microphone input. In it's current form, it is taken from an example at [p5](https://p5js.org/examples/sound-frequency-spectrum.html)

(note, you might need to allow microphone input in the upper left corner of the URL bar)

My hope in this project was to have a user interface where sounds could be generated, or to freeze the spectrum. This was based off of undergrad project to see how well the tamber of a sound could be reproduced knowing it's spectrum.
