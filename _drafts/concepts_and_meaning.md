# Concepts and Meaning

I think a lot of people in different fields have general intuitions of what a "concept" is. For some it might be a strictly intuitive idea with no strick definition, and for others (perhaps with more of a computer-science/philosophy background) it might be a *very* formal idea. The layout here will follow first my general feeling. Then, I will provide a brief idea of where it fits in relative to some dominant views in the field as presented in the Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy. I will then get into "the meat of it" with applications and implications of the ideas proposed here.

## My Approach

In keeping with my preffered style of conversing, I will start with the main punchline and then work to motivate it. 

I hope that the following sounds tautological and plainly obvious:

> "Concepts" are the things that meaning is about

What I mean by this is that concepts only have meaning in so much as there is a relationship between different concepts. I think that this principle fits with many theories, but I think it is important to explicitly draw it out. If a concept is thought of as an arbitrary symbol, then I would argue that the symbol gains "meaning" only by it's relation to other symbols. In a purely symbolic or feature based model, this could be captured in formal system through a list of propositions (e.g. **X** has wings). If a concept is a high-dimensional vector, then this is tantamount to saying "meaning" lies in the *geometry* implied by collection of a set of vectors. The key point I mean to hone in on is that an isolated concpept is not capable of have having "meaning". In this way, strictly speaking, "concepts" don't have meaning. 

Of course one could object to my laxical use of "meaning" here, but I really only intend to use the word for it's intuitive sense. I'm only using it to give insight into my line of reasoning.


I feel that prior to advancing to the central thesis of this post, I should clarify that I am *emphatically* in support of embodied/grounded theories of cognition. I certainly think that perceptual systems are **central** to what meaning is. I just want to clarify that I think it is the perceptual systems that give rise to constraints or relationships between "concepts" thus giving them meaning.

With that clarification, my central claim can be summarized as:

> Given a system that maps $$ R^n $$  to $$R^m$$, concepts are the highly occupied regions in phase-space (i.e. attractor basins) and *meaning* arises from the degrees of freedom implicit in the systems dynamics

I dont know if that makes sense but hopefully I can help

## Intuition

Why am I such a fervent believer in embodied theories of semantics? If you aren't familiar with the discussion of what were classically called amodal theories and grounded theories of semantics, I might suggest [this]() paper as a starting reference. In brief, grounded theories emphasize that the brain's perceptual systems play a critical role in conept representation.

A simple thought experiment that seems intuitvly obvious to me is the following:

> If someone was born congenitally blind (e.g. no eyes), could you explain to this person what the subjective experience of seeing *red* is?

Some people might try to play devils advocate, but I think that largely it feels that you could not. This has long been recognized in a similar question in that we might both point to an object and call it a particular color, but it seems that there would be no way for us to be sure that we actually experience the same color. In this case, a generalization is recognizing that every phenomoenolgical experience (the taste of something, the sound of something, the texture of something) could never be conveyed by words alone. It *requires* a first-hand experience of the experience. 

What this tells me is that first hand experience is reqiured
