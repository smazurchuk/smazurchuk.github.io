title: Finding Word Counts

# {{ page.title }}

I thought I might make a little post about to get some word counts. If you are in the MCW neurology department, then go ahead and ssh into my computer to get to a directory with a lot of text files. 

```bash
ssh $username@noether.neuro.mcw.edu
cd /mnt/data/smazurchuk/intern2crea/bookcorpus/out_txts
```

There are over 16,000 text files in this directory which are free books. To get word counts, we can simply use Grep!

The grep command for $word is:

```bash
grep -r -o -i -w $word | wc -l
```

*note: word is allowed to be a string with a space in it*

The grep options are:

| Option | Function  |
|--------|-----|
| -r | Just recursively goes through all files in directory tree  |
| -o | Print matched part of matching line, with each part on separate line  |
| -i | Ignore case    |
| -w | Match whole word (cannot be just part of a word)|
| wc | Word count|
| -l | Tell word could to count the number of lines|

The reason for writing the code this way is so that we can get a short python script which can use grep to get wordcounts for a list of words! Below is the code to accomplish just that

```py
wordList=['red','blue','words']; wordCnt=[]*len(wordList)
for idx, word in enumerate(wordList):
    wordCnt[idx] = int(os.popen('grep -r -o -i -w "'+ word + '" | wc -l').read())
```

## Double Counts
The astute reader might notice that some words will get double counted. That is, we don't want "baseball bat" in the count for "baseball". This can be remedied by noticing that one string is a strict substring of the other! We can simply iterate each word in the list across the other words, and if **a** is a substring of **b**, then we subtract the **count** of **a** from the count of **b**. You can verify this ("baseball bat" - "baseball"), and the corresponding code is here:

```py
for idx, tWord in enumerate(wordList):
    for idx2, word in enumerate(wordList):
        if tWord in word and idx!=idx2:
            wordCnt[idx] = wordCnt[idx]-wordCnt[idx2]
```
Hope that helps, and thanks for reading!
