# Concepts and Meaning

I think a lot of people in different fields have different general intuitions on this matter. I confess that I am no different and I thought that I might write down my own ideas here. In keeping with my preffered style of converying, I will start with the main punchline and then work to motivate it. 

I hope that the following sounds tautological and plainly obvious in nature:

> "Concepts" are the things that meaning is about

What I mean by this is that concepts only have meaning in so much as there is a relationship between different concepts. I think it is critical to make this distinction that strictly speaking "concepts" don't have meaning. In a sense, concepts could be arbitrary symbols. "Meaning" arises from how concepts relate to eachother. 

I feel that prior to advancing to the central thesis of this post, I should clarify that I am *emphatically* in support of embodied/grounded theories of cognition. I certainly think that perceptual systems are **central** to what meaning is. I just want to clarify that I think it is the perceptual systems that give rise to constraints or relationships between "concepts" thus giving them meaning.

With that clarification, my central claim can be summarized as:

> Given a system that maps $$ R^n $$  to $$R^m$$, concepts are the highly occupied regions in phase-space (i.e. attractor basins) and *meaning* arises from the degrees of freedom implicit in the systems dynamics

I dont know if that makes sense but hopefully I can help

## Intuition

Why am I such a fervent believer in embodied theories of semantics? If you aren't familiar with the discussion of what were classically called amodal theories and grounded theories of semantics, I might suggest [this]() paper as a starting reference. In brief, grounded theories emphasize that the brain's perceptual systems play a critical role in conept representation.

A simple thought experiment that seems intuitvly obvious to me is the following:

> If someone was born congenitally blind (e.g. no eyes), could you explain to this person what the subjective experience of seeing *red* is?

Some people might try to play devils advocate, but I think that largely it feels that you could not. This has long been recognized in a similar question in that we might both point to an object and call it a particular color, but it seems that there would be no way for us to be sure that we actually experience the same color. In this case, a generalization is recognizing that every phenomoenolgical experience (the taste of something, the sound of something, the texture of something) could never be conveyed by words alone. It *requires* a first-hand experience of the experience.
