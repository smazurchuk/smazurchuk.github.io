title: Creating a GLM for SOE Data

# {{ page.title }}

I thought it might be useful to have a little tutorial about how the GLM maps are created for the SOE data. I am basing this off the current method I found in Tony's script.

When creating a GLM all regressors need to be combined into a large matrix. We can create a python function which copies CSV files

* Why is SMPG1 used instead of a multiple basis functions??
