One concept that is driven home in any statistical mechanics course is that the energy distribution of particles in an ideal gas follows the boltzman distribution. An ideal gas inculdes several assumptions, one of which is that a particles energy is equal to its kinetic energy (i.e. there is no potential energy term between pairs of particles which assumes large distances between particles). As such, the average speed of a particle is proportional to the **squareroot of the boltzmann distribution**.
