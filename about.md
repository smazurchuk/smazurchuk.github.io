Hi! This is a website I've written for documenting procedures, work-flows, and musings in the lab. While snippits of scripts can be found here, no lab data is hosted on github. I'm hoping to provide a resource which explains some important concepts about how data is processed in the lab


The theme for this website is the default jekyll theme, with documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

I've only slightly modified these base themes.
