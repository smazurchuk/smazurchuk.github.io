title: Creating a GLM for SOE Data
date: 2019-12-05
---
I thought it might be useful to have a little tutorial about how the GLM maps are created for the SOE data. I am basing this off the current method in Tony's scripts.

## Processing Scripts
The general process of creating $$\beta$$-maps for each word requires regressingn out words, nuissance regressors and motion.

# Building Word and Nuissance Regressors
The first step is to make 1d regressor files to feed into afni.Tony has a script, `regressors.py` which which has several functions:

 * build_large_file - converts psychopy table into python variable with proper format
 * demean_and_write - groups reaction time into 6 groups (2 per session), and converts reaction times into z-scores
 * word_length   - creates word-length as a nuisance regressor
 * word_stim_time   - creates 1d arrays for target word and all other words
 * copy_anat      - uses `3dcopy` to copy anatomy files (not sure why?)

At the end of all this work, we have generated the files

# Building Motion Regressors

The script `3dDcon_Preparation.py` generates the motion regressors.

# 3dDeconvolve Script

Tony then has a script for running 3d deconvolve which has the following functions:
 * extract_words - creates list of words based on file names in patient directory
 * separate_words - creates several subgroups of words (fed in as argument)
 * Set_the_deconvolve_line - This is used to create the design matrix which is fed into the next step. The regressors included here are:

    | Censor Regressor | Motion censor |
    | Target word regressor | This is the time point for the word of interest (6 time points) |
    | All other words | This is a regressor for AOW |
    | Word length regressor | This is a regressor for visual information |
    | Response Time regressor | This is the reaction time z-score. This is thought to correlate with overall word difficulty. **Note**: *This is split into 6 different groups, so this is really 6 different regressors* |
    | Motion demean | Not really sure? |
    | Motion derivitive | Not sure how generated |



 * Set_the_Remlfit_line - 

# Running the Script
The last part of the script is used to generate the $$\beta$$ values

## Final Steps
Tony has already run the regression script for each patient, so all that remains is setting the deconvolve command. This can be done by simply submitting the script.



When creating a GLM all regressors need to be combined into a large matrix. We can create a python function which copies CSV files

# Thoughts / Q's
* Why is SMPG1 used instead of a multiple basis functions?
